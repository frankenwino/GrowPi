GrowPi is a Raspberry Pi-based IoT system for collecting and transmitting environmental sensor data, such as temperature and humidity. It includes Python scripts for sensor readings, a local API for on-demand measurements, and a data sender that pushes readings to a central backend. Designed for integration with a full-stack thesis project, GrowPi ensures efficient data collection and real-time monitoring.
